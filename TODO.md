# TODO

A list of some of the things to be done to tidy up my general Haskell setup


- [X] Upgrade all Haskell repos to GHC 8.8.x
- [ ] Try setting up different formatting providers in `haskell-language-server`
- [ ] Document setting up `hoogle`
- [ ] Test out 'docs on hover' feature in `haskell-language-server` for
  3rd-party dependencies (see [issue
  #208](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/208))
- [ ] Work out how to get Haddock docs appearing in hover for internal functions
